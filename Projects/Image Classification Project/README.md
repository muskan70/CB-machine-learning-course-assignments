# Multiclass Image Classification Project

**Problem Statement** : Given a dataset of images of 4 categories - cats,dogs,horses,humans of different sizes with labels.Train a model to classify these images.

Learning Goals
- How to read different size images from a directory?
- How to implement One-vs-one scheme for Multiclass classification?
- How to use SVM for image classifcation?

### Implementations :
- Data Preparation using keras
- SVM scratch implementation
- One vs one scratch implementation
- sklearn svm

### Results :
- One vs one Classifier using svm accuracy: 62%
- Sklearn svm accuracy: 66%
