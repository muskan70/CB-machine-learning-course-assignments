# K Nearest Neighbours Algorithm

1. It is supervised learning algorithm

2. It is used for both classification and regression

3. It is simple and intuitive , No training is required

4. All calculations happen at query time. Each query takes O(nlog(n)) time

- Also implemented knn on MNIST dataset to recognize Handwritten Digits.
