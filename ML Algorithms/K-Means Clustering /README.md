# K-Means Clustering 

- It is an unsupervised learning algorithm.

- It is used to group common data together,

- Common clustering technique

- It is hard clustering where evry point belongs to only one cluster.

- By K-Means, it means partiion the data into k clusters.

- It fails on complex datasets.

- K-Means is special case of Expectation Maximzation Algorithm.

## DBSCAN

- Density based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise

- Based upon the idea that a cluster is a high density area surrounded by low density region

#### This folder includes code of the following:

- K-Means Implementation from scratch

- K-Means sklearn Implementation

- DBSCAN Implementation
