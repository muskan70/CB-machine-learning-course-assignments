# K-Means Clustering 

- It is an unsupervised learning algorithm.

- It is used to group common data together,

- Common clustering technique

- It is hard clustering where evry point belongs to only one cluster.

- By K-Means, it means partiion the data into k clusters.

- It fails on complex datasets.

- K-Means is special case of Expectation Maximzation Algorithm.

## K-Means Algorithm

Input Data : X = {x1,...,xN}

Goal : Partition the data among some K number of clusters. Let us assume K is known to us.

Let µk denote the center of Kth Cluster (uk will be vector)

So we need to ﬁnd an assignment of data points to clusters, as well as a set of cluster centers{µk}, such that the sum of the squares of the distances of each data point to its closest cluster center µk, is a minimum.

## DBSCAN

- Density based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise

- Based upon the idea that a cluster is a high density area surrounded by low density region

#### This folder includes code of the following:

- K-Means Implementation from scratch

- K-Means sklearn Implementation (K-Means++)

- DBSCAN Implementation
